  <h2>State of Development - 09/06/2024</h2>
  <p>
    Hi gang, the WatermelonKatana development team has been a tad bit inactive lately, but we're still working on the site. Just slowly but surely.
    WatermelonKatana is a huge dream of ours, and we're not giving up on it.

    Some of the things we're working hard on right now are:
    <ul>
      <li>Updating the sites overall look, with new UI elements</li>
      <li>Working on getting a gamejam posting system finished.</li>
      <li>An updated moderation / administration panel (Yes, this means we will be looking for moderators soon!)</li>
      <li>And a few other things we can't talk about yet.</li>
    </ul>
    We apologize for the lack of updates, but we're working hard to make this website the best it can be.

    Keep on posting your games, and we'll keep on working.
  </p>
  <h3>Thanks, <br><strong>- Colack and the WatermelonKatana development team.</strong></h3>
